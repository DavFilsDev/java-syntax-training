# 🧪 OOP Exercise 1: Encapsulation in Java

## 🎯 Objective

This exercise is designed to help you understand the concept of **encapsulation** in object-oriented programming using Java.

You'll learn how to:

- Define private fields to restrict direct access.
- Use **getters** and **setters** to access or update data.
- Create constructors to initialize objects.
- Apply access modifiers: `private`, `public`.
- Display object state in a clean and safe way.

## 📁 Files

- `Person.java`: Defines a `Person` class with private fields `name` and `age`, with public getter/setter methods.
- `TestPerson.java`: Contains a `main` method to create, modify and display a `Person` instance.

## 🔄 Example Output

```bash
Name: Alice, Age: 25
Name: Bob, Age: 30
