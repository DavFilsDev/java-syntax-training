# Exercise 4 â€“ Interface: Soundable

This exercise helps you practice **interfaces** and **polymorphism** in Java.

## Objectives

- Learn how to define and implement an interface.
- Understand polymorphism using an interface reference.
- Practice calling overridden methods through interface abstraction.

## Structure

- `Soundable`: Interface with a `makeSound()` method.
- `Animal`: Abstract base class for all animals.
- `Dog`, `Cat`, `Cow`: Each implements `Soundable` and defines its own `makeSound()` method.
- `TestSoundable`: Demonstrates the interface usage.
