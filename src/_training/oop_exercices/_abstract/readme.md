# Exercise 3 â€“ Abstract Class: Shape

This exercise introduces the concept of **abstract classes** in Java.

## Objectives

- Understand how to define and use abstract classes.
- Practice implementing abstract methods in child classes.
- Learn polymorphism by interacting with abstract references.

## Structure

- `Shape`: Abstract class with an abstract method `getArea()`.
- `Circle`: Subclass that calculates the area of a circle.
- `Rectangle`: Subclass that calculates the area of a rectangle.
- `TestShape`: Main class to demonstrate polymorphism with abstract references.
