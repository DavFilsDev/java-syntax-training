# Java Syntax Training 🚀

Welcome to the **Java Syntax Training** repository — a structured and well-documented space where I practice and consolidate my Java learning journey, from the basics to object-oriented programming (OOP) and problem-solving challenges.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This repository serves three main goals:

1. **Master Java fundamentals and syntax** through organized lessons and examples.
2. **Build up object-oriented programming concepts** using real, understandable examples.
3. **Solve training challenges** from platforms like Codewars to apply what I’ve learned.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized by topic, following a progression from basics to advanced:

```

java-syntax-training/
├── src/
│   ├── basics/           # Variables, data types, casting, operators, input
│   ├── controlflow/      # if/else, switch, nested conditions
│   ├── loops/            # for, while, do-while, break/continue
│   ├── arrays/           # Arrays creation, traversal, operations
│   ├── methods/          # Defining, calling, parameters, return values
│   ├── oop/              # All OOP concepts split into sub-packages:
│   │   ├── classesobjects/
│   │   ├── constructors/
│   │   ├── inheritance/
│   │   ├── encapsulation/
│   │   ├── abstraction/
│   │   ├── interfaces/
│   └── \_training/        # Kata, problem-solving and practice
├── .gitignore
├── README.md

## 🛠️ Git & Branch Workflow

To keep the project well-organized and modular, I followed a feature-branch workflow:

- For each **topic** (e.g., loops, methods), I create a branch like:  
  `feature/loops-basics`, `feature/oop-encapsulation`, etc.

- I use Pull Requests with clear descriptions and merge them into:
  - Topic parent branches (e.g., `feature/oop-package`)
  - Then into the main branch (`main`)

For training challenges:
- I create a branch per session like `feature/training-session-1` and merge into `main`.

## 💡 What You Will Learn

Each folder is packed with example `.java` files and **detailed comments** to explain the concept in a simple way. You’ll find:

- 📌 `VariablesDemo.java`, `OperatorsDemo.java`, `UserInputExample.java`
- 🔁 `ForLoopExample.java`, `WhileLoopExample.java`, etc.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 `Student.java`, `Animal.java`, `Person.java` in the OOP section
- 🤔 Real problems like `PalindromeChecker.java`, `DuplicateEncoder.java` in `_training/`

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a **personal learning project**, but feel free to explore or fork it if you’re learning Java too! You’ll find detailed code and step-by-step learning examples.

## 📌 Notes

- `.idea/` and `.iml` project files are excluded via `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean.
- Every topic is version-controlled using Git for best practices.
